## Iteration 1 - Review & Reteospective

- June 14, 2024
- Where: Discord

## Process - Reflection

We reviewed the work done during the first iteration and discussed the following points:

### What Went Well
#### Frequent Communication
Throughout the duration of the sprint, we were in constant communciaton with each other. This allowed us to quickly address any issues that arose and to keep each other updated on our progress. We also made use of the Discord server to share resources and to discuss any questions or concerns that we had.

#### Development Progress
We were able to make significant progress on the development of the application during this sprint. We were able to implement the basic functionality of the application, including user authentication, course creation, and course joining. We also made progress on the design of the application, including the layout and styling of the pages.


### What Could Have Gone Better

#### Time Management
We could have managed our time more effectively during this sprint. There were a few instances where we underestimated the amount of time that certain tasks would take, which resulted in some tasks not being completed on time. In the future, we will need to be more mindful of our time and make sure that we are allocating enough time for each task.

#### Testing
We could have done a better job of testing the application during this sprint. While we did some manual testing of the application, we did not have a formal testing plan in place, which resulted in some bugs and issues not being caught until late in the sprint. In the future, we will need to develop a more comprehensive testing plan and make sure that we are testing the application thoroughly.

### Action Items
Based on the points discussed above, we have identified the following action items for the next sprint:

#### Allocated Time for Tasks
We will make sure to allocate enough time for each task in the next sprint and to be more mindful of our time management.

#### Testing Plan
We will develop a more comprehensive testing plan for the next sprint and make sure that we are testing the application thoroughly. We will be utilizing the built-in testing library in Go to write unit tests for our code.

#### CI/CD
Following the testing plan, we will implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of the application. This will help us catch bugs and issues earlier in the development process and ensure that the application is always in a deployable state.


## Product - Review

### What Was Accomplished
As discussed in the process reflection, we were able to make significant progress on the development of the application during this sprint. We were able to implement the basic functionality of the application, including user authentication, course creation, and course joining. We also made progress on the design of the application, including the layout and styling of the pages.


### What Wasn't Accomplished
There was a main feature that was not completed this feature was the ability to view all buildings on campus and join rooms in those buildings. This feature was not completed due to time constraints and will be carried over to the next sprint.


## Meeting Highlights

Going forward, our main initiatives are going to be:

#### Task Distribution
We will be more mindful of how we distribute tasks among the team members to ensure that everyone has a balanced workload and that tasks are completed on time.

#### Testing
We will be implementing a more comprehensive testing plan for the next sprint to ensure that the application is thoroughly tested and that bugs and issues are caught early in the development process.

#### CI/CD
We will be implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of the application. This will help us catch bugs and issues earlier in the development process and ensure that the application is always in a deployable state.
