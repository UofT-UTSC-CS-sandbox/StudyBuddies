## Release Planning Meeting
The release planning meeting was held on June 2nd on Discord. Every member of our group attended the meeting.

## Release Goals:
The main objective of this release is to develop a mobile application that allows users to register, identify their current position on the map relative to "hotspots" on campus and store their personal information and course selections. Users should begin to understand the nature of the campus and popular activities. They should also be able to modify their personal information that was updated. The application will also include functionality for the user to see markers of popular locations on the map for the courses they are studying.

## Scope:
Users should be able to:
Log in or sign up to access the platform. I can then access the dashboard where I can view relevant information. I can also look at my profile and edit it. (MIN-1, 2)

View current, realtime location on the map that updates asynchronously.

View the location of key markers on the map.

Upload their personal information and store it. Including photo, display name, and enrolled courses.

Modify their personal information including photo, display name, and enrolled courses.
