## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospective

- **Date:** July 19, 2024
- **Location:** Discord

## Process - Reflection

During our second iteration review, we focused on evaluating our performance and identifying areas for improvement.

### What Went Well
#### Pair Programming and Communication
Our use of pair programming and consistent communication was a major strength, allowing us to quickly resolve issues and keep everyone informed of our progress.

#### Development Progress
We made significant strides in various areas, including the functionality for searching rooms and buildings, searching for friends and creating study groups. We also included a timer and some basic functionality for study analytics.  Additionally, the layout and styling of our application pages saw notable enhancements.

### What Could Have Gone Better

#### Time Management
We struggled with time management and setting aside dedicated work periods. Tasks often took longer than anticipated, which affected our overall productivity.

#### Learning the Tech Stack
Familiarizing ourselves with the tech stack proved to be challenging, impacting our speed and efficiency in certain aspects of development.

### Action Items
Based on our reflections, we have identified key action items for the upcoming sprint:

#### Improving Time Allocation
We will focus on more effective time allocation, ensuring tasks are realistically scheduled and completed on time.

#### Implementing Pending Features
We will prioritize the implementation of the friend-adding system which is the building block to several other features, which was deferred from this sprint.

## Product - Review

### What Was Accomplished
We made progress in implementing key functionalities such as study analytics, self study timer and search for friends/group chats. 

### What Wasn't Accomplished
The friend-adding system was not implemented as planned due to time constraints. This feature will be prioritized in the next sprint.

## Meeting Highlights

Looking ahead, our primary goals include:

#### Optimized Task Management
We will refine our approach to task distribution to optimize team workload and ensure timely completion.

#### Enhanced Testing
We will implement a comprehensive testing plan supported by a CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early in development.

#### Focus on Tech Proficiency
We aim to improve our proficiency with the tech stack through targeted learning and practical application.
