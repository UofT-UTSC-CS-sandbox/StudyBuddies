The critical path includes all tasks that directly affect the project's completion time. To determine this, we need to look for the longest sequence of dependent tasks. Hereâ€™s the critical path identified:

A: Implement functionality for goal creation and completion and study timer (3 days)
G: Add official course list from UofT to database (2 days)
J: Frontend implementation for searching group chats (3 days)
The critical path is A -> G -> J, which totals 8 days.

# Work Habit Modifications

Based on the critical path analysis, our team has prioritized critical tasks (A, G, and J) to ensure timely completion by allocating additional support and resources to these tasks. We have also adopted parallel processing for non-critical tasks (B, C, D, E, F, H, and I) to maintain overall project progress without interfering with the critical path. Additionally, we increased the frequency of check-ins and stand-ups to monitor the progress of critical tasks closely and promptly address any blockers.
