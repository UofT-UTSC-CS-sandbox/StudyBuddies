# StudyBuddies

StudyBuddies is a hybrid interactive learning and social media app for University students intended to simplify socialization through the common theme of academic success. It allows students to create new friendships, collaborate on course topics, track their academic progress and add overall convenience to student experience. A key problem that most students are facing at the University of Toronto, is isolation. This plays a role into academic performance, and when the stakes are high and one wants to succeed, something as simple as socialization shouldn't be a barrier. StudyBuddies provides its users with the ability to create study groups and track "high activity" study zones so that users can create study groups and meet new people. Users will have the ability to add friends, message them and even create a network.

From an student's perspective, StudyBuddies offers a one-stop-shop for all things school related. This includes tools to focus and increase productivity, goal setting and performance analytics and most importantly, networking and creating a great group of friends. Ideally, StudyBuddies serves as an alternative to doom scrolling with micro-learning and socialization, two of the purest forms of dopamine. Our application also provides students with other useful tools during their study sessions such as a pomodoro timer, a habit builder and a journaling feature. StudyBuddies takes inspiration from a common problem faced at commuter schools such as UTSC and blends the camaraderie of social media with the the desire to perform well.



## Problem
At "commuter schools" such as TMU and UofT many students face social isolation, especially in comparison to counterparts such as Western and Queens. It is a lot more difficult to create meaningful friendships or meet people in general due to the culture around the schools. A recent study has found that over 30% of UofT students have a commute time of over an hour. Students arrive on campus for lecture or assessments and leave promptly, leaving little room for social interactions. A lack of social interactions can amplify the hardships that one has to deal with, especially when there is external pressure to succeed. For many, making friends is difficult and going out of your way on class discussion boards can be seen as awkward. To add insult to injury, many courses consist of group projects as a large percentage of the syllabus and without knowing anyone in the course, your grade could be in jeopardy.

## Our Target Audience
StudyBuddies caters to a singular umbrella target audience: undergraduate university students attending schools with a large student-commuter population. By utilizing StudyBuddies, students can skip a lot of the awkwardness of trying to create friendships, this is because they can unite under the common theme of academic excellence. This is particularly beneficial for high performing students who experience frustration and even difficulties during their studies due to social isolation or not having a good support system of peers taking the same classes. StudyBuddies aims to streamline this multi-faceted problem of attending post secondary institutions, by providing users with the infrastructure to succeed in their classes while making their time at school worthwhile. By connecting these two key issues, StudyBuddies enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of university students trying to enjoy their experience to the fullest!

## Why Choose Our Product

By choosing StudyBuddies as a social media platform, users will develop a competitive edge over their peers as they will be immersed into an environment of academic success. Our product takes the novelty of common social media apps like TikTok and Instagram while leveraging what makes them most enjoyable into something productive. Many people don't want the added baggage or distractions that come from traditional social media apps and desire to immerse themselves in the best possible network to ensure their success.

What sets StudyBuddies apart from other social media platforms, such as Instagram or Discord, is its focus on academic success and the tools it provides to support that goal. StudyBuddies realtime location system allows users to understand the social climate of their campus better and the best areas to study if they are looking to find peers. Furthermore, there are tools such as our performance analytics tracker, habit setting and micro-learning video tool that have been proven to improve academic performance. While Discord and Instagram may be used as somewhat "friend making" or "collaborative" alternatives, they come with downsides and unwanted distractions. For instance, one may not feel comfortable enough to invite someone into their private life by adding them on Instagram and doesn't promote face to face connections


StudyBuddies takes inspiration from three primary platforms, Discord, Snapchat, and TikTok. By leveraging the power of location tracking, users are able to more easily identify the "hot spots" on campus similar to SnapMaps. Users can also revise by using their self-curated short form learning videos, unlike Tiktok. Lastly, they can create communities based on their academic goals however, resulting in face-to-face interaction, unlike Discord.


## Market Sizing Analysis

Our addressable market is individuals attending post secondary institutions with a "commuter majority". To name a few in Canada, UofT, TMU, Seneca, Centennial College and etc. would be target schools. Our solution will always have a market due to the fact that there's always a high demands for students attending post secondary institutions. Furthermore, there isn't currently a social media platform that is primarily based in interactive education in the market, this is a more niche target space. Eventually, we can continue development to support universities across the continent.



## What Does "Done" Mean
"Done" means that all necessary functionality and requirements of all user stories have been successfully implemented. From a bird's-eye perspective, this implies that, at its core functionality, users should be able to create an account and build a comprehensive profile, including finding friends, track locations of their friends, and collaborate to a common academic goal. This also includes the users ability to interact with their friends and create small study groups. Upon creating an account, users should have the ability to track their own academic progress in relation to other users and network in order to improve their academic standing. Furthermore, users should be able to self-document short videos of their learning to revise later for their own uses. Lastly, we should exhaust our product-backlog should new user stories be added.
