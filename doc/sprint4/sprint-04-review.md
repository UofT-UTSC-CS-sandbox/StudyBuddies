## Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospective

- **Date:** August 2, 2024
- **Location:** Discord

## Process - Reflection

During our fourth iteration review, we focused on evaluating our performance and identifying areas for improvement.

### What Went Well
#### Pair Programming and Communication
Our use of pair programming and consistent communication continued to be a major strength, allowing us to quickly resolve issues and keep everyone informed of our progress.

#### Development Progress
We successfully implemented the friends system, including adding friends and seeing their location. Additionally, we made significant strides in study analytics, which now includes time studied per course and time studied vs. grade.

### What Could Have Gone Better

#### Time Management
While there was some improvement, we still faced challenges with time management and setting aside dedicated work periods. Tasks often took longer than anticipated, affecting our overall productivity.

#### Learning the Tech Stack
Although our familiarity with the tech stack has improved, it still impacted our speed and efficiency in certain aspects of development.

### Action Items
Based on our reflections, we have identified key action items for the upcoming sprint:

#### Improving Time Allocation
We will continue to focus on more effective time allocation, ensuring tasks are realistically scheduled and completed on time.

#### Implementing Pending Features
We will prioritize the implementation of the features still on our product backlog, such as uploading videos and files.

## Product - Review

### What Was Accomplished
We made progress in implementing key functionalities such as the friends system (adding friends and seeing their location) and study analytics (time studied per course and time studied vs. grade).

### What Wasn't Accomplished
The features for uploading videos and files were not implemented as planned due to time constraints. These features will be prioritized in the next sprint.

## Meeting Highlights

Looking ahead, our primary goals include:

#### Optimized Task Management
We will refine our approach to task distribution to optimize team workload and ensure timely completion.


#### More iOS Development
We will increase our focus on iOS development to enhance the user experience on Apple devices.

#### Better Communication
We will improve our communication strategies to ensure all team members are aligned and informed throughout the development process.
