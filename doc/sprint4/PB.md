# User Stories Priority

**High:**
1. As a standard user, I want to be able to upload files and images into the group chat, so that other users can access what I uploaded.
2. As a standard user, I want to be able to remove people from my group, so that I can ensure that I only study with people I enjoy.
3. As a standard user, I want to be able to delete my unique account and my personal data stored within the app, so that I can ensure my data is removed when I no longer use the app.
4. As a standard user, I want to restrict users, so that I can protect myself from users who may harass me.

**Medium:**
5. As a standard user, I want to be able to view my study analytics and contrast them with the average StudyBuddy user, so that I can see how I stack up to the average student.

**Low:**
6. As a standard user, I want to be able to post short clips of explanations of the topic I am studying, so others can find it easier to learn the same topic.
