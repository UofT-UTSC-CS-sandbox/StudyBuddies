## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospective

- July 5, 2024
- Where: Discord

## Process - Reflection

We reviewed the work done during the second iteration and discussed the following points:

### What Went Well
#### Pair Programming and Communication
Pair programming and constant communication were highlights of this sprint. They enabled us to resolve issues quickly and stay updated on our progress.

#### Development Progress
Significant progress was made on various fronts, including searching rooms and buildings, as well as creating groups for studying. The layout and styling of application pages also saw substantial improvement.

### What Could Have Gone Better

#### Time Management
Time management and setting aside dedicated work time were challenges in this sprint. Tasks took longer than expected, impacting our overall productivity.

#### Learning Tech Stack
Getting acquainted with the tech stack posed difficulties. This hindered our speed and efficiency in some areas of development.

### Action Items
Based on our reflections, we've identified key action items for the upcoming sprint:

#### Addressing Time Allocation
We will allocate time more effectively, ensuring tasks are realistically scheduled and completed on time.

#### Tech Stack Proficiency
We plan to dedicate more focused time to learning the tech stack, aiming to improve our efficiency in development.

#### Pending Feature Implementation
We will prioritize implementing the friend adding system, which was deferred from this sprint.

## Product - Review

### What Was Accomplished
Progress was made in implementing essential functionalities such as searching rooms and buildings, and creating groups for studying. Design improvements were also notable achievements.

### What Wasn't Accomplished
The friend adding system was not implemented as planned, due to time constraints. This feature will be prioritized in the next sprint.

## Meeting Highlights

Moving forward, our primary goals include:

#### Improved Task Management
We will refine our approach to task distribution to optimize team workload and ensure timely completion.

#### Enhanced Testing
A comprehensive testing plan will be implemented, supported by a CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early in development.

#### Focus on Tech Proficiency
We aim to enhance our proficiency with the tech stack through targeted learning and practical application.
