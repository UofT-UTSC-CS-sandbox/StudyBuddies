User Stories Priority

**High:**
1. As a standard user, I want to be able to find other users studying the same course as me, so that I can go and study with them.
2. As a standard user, I want to be able to upload files and images into the group chat, so that other users can access what I uploaded.
3. As a standard user, I want my groupâ€™s study location to only be accessible to friends of my groupmates, so that strangers do not join my group.
4. As a standard user, I want to be able to remove people from my group, so that I can ensure that I only study with people I enjoy.
5. As a standard user, I want to be able to create a profile to represent myself better to other users using the app, so that I can make meaningful connections.
6. As a standard user, I want to be able to delete my unique account and my personal data stored within the app, so that I can ensure my data is removed when I no longer use the app.
7. As a standard user, I want to restrict users, so that I can protect myself from users who may harass me.


**Medium:**
1. As a standard user, I want to view my study analytics and see how much I study on average, so that I can keep myself accountable.
2. As a premium user, I want to view where and when my courses tend to be studied, so that I can better plan when to study any particular course.
3. As a premium user, I want to be able to view my study analytics and contrast them with the average StudyBuddy user, so that I can see how I stack up to the average student.

**Low:**
1. As a standard user, I want to be able to upgrade my account from standard to premium, so that I can get access to extra features.
2. As a standard user, I want to be able to make my group private so other users are unable to find my group.
3. As a standard user, I want to be able to post short clips of explanations of the topic I am studying, so others can find it easier to learn the same topic.
